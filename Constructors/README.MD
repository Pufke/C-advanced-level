# WAYS TO CREATE OBJECTS

***Myclass *object = new Myclass();*** //object has dynamic storage duration (usually is on the heap)
You create object on this way if you plan on using them throughout (***a long period of time***)

***Myclass object;*** //object has automatic storage duration (usually is on the stack)
You create object on this way if you plan on using them for (***a short lifetime (or scope).***)
